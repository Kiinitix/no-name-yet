Virtual Machine Introspection Based Malware Detection Approach at Hypervisor for Virtualized Cloud Computing Environment using Adversarial Autoencoder Neural Networks. Cloud computing enabled by virtualization technology exhibits a revolutionary change in information technology infrastructure. The hypervisor is a pillar of virtualization and it allows to abstract the host or bare hardware resources to the Virtual Machines (VMs) which are running on the virtualized environment. As the VMs are easily available for rent from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that are a prime target for malignant cloud user or an adversary to launch the attacks and to execute the sophisticated malware by exploiting the identi ed vulnerability present in it. In addition, the proliferation of unknown malware exposes the limitations of traditional and VM-based anti-malware defensive solutions. These motivated the development of secure hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) based solutions. The Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) has emerged as a ne-grained out-of-VM security solution to detect the malware by introspecting and reconstructing the volatile memory state of the live guest Operating System (OS) by functioning at VMM.
